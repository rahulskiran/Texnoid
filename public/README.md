Place your logo file here with the name: `texnoid-logo.png`

The logo should be:
- PNG format (or JPG/JPEG if you prefer - just update the filename in the component)
- Recommended size: 200x200px or larger (will be scaled down)
- Transparent background preferred

The logo will be automatically used in:
- Navigation header
- Footer

If the logo file is not found, a fallback "T" icon will be displayed.
